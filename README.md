README.md:


Blasphemer aims to create a free content package for the Heretic engine, with a theme of metal-inspired dark fantasy.

Any limit-removing Doom source port that is compatible with Heretic can be used to play Blasphemer. Blasphemer is an iwad, meaning the complete set of resources required for a game but still requires an executable engine to be played. You can turn your favorite Heretic pwads into Lovecraftian nightmares using Blasphemer.

# Make sure to use "-deh blasphem.hhe -hhever 1.3" with crispy-heretic.
# Will need to use "-heretic" with dsda-heretic.

While Blasphemer is currently fully playable, there are still many resources that need to be created or polished. You can become a contributor by submitting a new or modified resource. See the Contributing and wiki for more information:
